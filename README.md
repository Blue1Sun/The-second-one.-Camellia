# The second one. Camellia
The development of the game "The second one. Camellia" started on **11.02.2019** and is expeted to be finished by **2020**.

The graphic part of the project were created by Yana Knyazkova specifically for this game. You can check her other works on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/haruhy3050).

The first beta trailer of the game you can see [here](https://vimeo.com/339386213).

There is still a lot of work to be done, but we are trying out best to upload our game to Steam!

The project is open for non-profit use. I hope you understand.
